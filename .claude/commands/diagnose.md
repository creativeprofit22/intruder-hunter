Help me run a full security diagnosis on my Linux system.

Guide me through:
1. Running the intruder-hunter.sh script
2. Understanding the output
3. Deciding which fixes to apply
4. Answering any questions I have about the findings

Start by checking if the script exists, then run it with sudo. Explain each section of the output as we go. After the scan completes, help me understand if my system is safe and what actions I should take.

Be thorough but don't scare me unnecessarily - explain what's normal vs actually concerning.
