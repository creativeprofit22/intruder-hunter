Help me harden my Linux system security.

Run through the standard hardening steps:
1. Apply all security updates
2. Enable and configure the UFW firewall
3. Run rootkit scanners (rkhunter, chkrootkit)
4. Check for dangerous sudo configurations
5. Configure automatic security updates

For each step, explain what it does before running it. If something requires my password, show me the command to run manually.

At the end, summarize what was done and confirm the system is hardened.
